# About Me


- 🦹 Software engineer specializing in **Flutter** and **Godot**, with a foundation in **Python**, **Java**,**dart** and **GDScript**.
- 🏗️ Passionate about developing apps to save the world from the terminators while looking good doing it. As long as it's not Nano or Emacs, count me in...more of Vim fan
- 🌍 I thrive on challenges, tackling problems not because they are easy, but because I thought they would be easy.
- 🎓 Currently a software engineering student, balancing intense schoolwork with occasional ventures into the great outdoors—after all, balance is key
- 👨‍💻 By day, I'm a Java Developer; 🥷🏻 by night, I dive into game development.

🐧 And no, I don't use Arch, btw :o
