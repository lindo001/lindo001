# About Me:


🌍 Developing apps to save the world from the terminators while looking cool doing it. As long as it's not Nano, count me in. I thrive on challenges, tackling problems not because they are easy, but because I was told they would be easier is how I found myself here :^. That aside, I'm currently a software engineering student at WTC. If I'm not buried in schoolwork, you might find me touching grass. After all, balance is key!
